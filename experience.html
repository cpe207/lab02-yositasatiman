        <p> I study computer engineering, so I need to learn coding and creating things with computer skills. </p>
        <p><br> We started with the basics, like making a game with Scratch.</br></p>
        <p><br> His project was a group effort, and I took on roles as Manager, Creative, and Graphics Designer.</br></p>
        <p><br> Even though Scratch isn't the best tool for making games, we managed to create a game successfully.</br></p>
        <p><br> It was very challenging, and although our game wasn't the best, it was full of our dedication.</br></p>

       <p> As I progressed in my computer engineering studies, I found that many things were quite difficult for me and not easy to understand in a short time.</p>
       <p><br> One of these challenges was coding in C++. This project was also a group effort, and my roles included Coding, Graphics Designer, and Tester.</br></p>
       <p><br> Our project was an oracle card fortune-telling application. This project was very difficult for me, but we managed to complete it.</br></p>
       <p><br> Though it wasn't as good as it could have been, it wasn't terrible either.</br></p>
       <p><br> Gained a lot of experience from this project.</br></p>
